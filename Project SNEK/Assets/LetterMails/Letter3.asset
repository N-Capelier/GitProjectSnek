    seen each other. Time goes like crazy right? Don\u2019t you think we should meet
    again sometime? I\u2019m completely free this month if you want. I heard you
    were gone for a while, we can talk about that. You know I\u2019ll always be there
    for you.\r\n\nYour one and only best friend,\r\nJack\r\n"
