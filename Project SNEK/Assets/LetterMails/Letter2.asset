  title: From Rachel
  text: "How is it going? The blue sky, the birds singing, the cozy chalet, making
    yourself comfortable? I\u2019m glad you finally took time for yourself girl!
    You need that! You were always so busy here. The restaurant has been in a frenzy
    since you were gone. Gosh, taking care of the service without you has been hell
    on rush hours! But we\u2019ll work it out. I can\u2019t wait for you to return
    with us. Who is going to make slide-on-the-tables races with me after closure
    now? \r\nBut please take care and rest a lot before coming back!\r\n\r\nThinking
    of you,\r\nRachel\r\n"
