  text: "Dear L\xE9ana,\r\nDrawing classes feel emptier now that you\u2019re gone.
    Your creativity inspired many of your fellow classmates, you know? But taking
    a break is important and you need that. Feel free to retire for as long as you
    want: a seat will always wait for you here, for when you\u2019re ready, at your
    own pace. It is important to recharge and meet with yourself at some point.\r\n\nYour
    well being is all that matters,\r\nMarcus\r\n"
